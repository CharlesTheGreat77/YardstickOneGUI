# In Progress!
Updates will come in time...

# Receive signals
https://github.com/CharlesTheGreat77/YardstickOneGUI/assets/27988707/c19f699a-7f8c-487d-b116-0f1deaf68a25

- best to click modulation in use before hitting configure button
  to ensure yardstick one is configured with appropriate modulation.

# Save signals
https://github.com/CharlesTheGreat77/YardstickOneGUI/assets/27988707/2d04f052-07ba-4b5b-916c-a50f50db6dbf

- Signals are saved in ".cap" file format.
  Frequency:
  Modulation:
  Payload:

# Transmit signals (received) OR Transmit Tesla Charging Port signal
https://github.com/CharlesTheGreat77/YardstickOneGUI/assets/27988707/2947c33f-48bc-44cd-bb0e-6a98586e44ea

- All signals in the output are sent once
- Tesla charging port signal is sent on both 315Mhz & 433.92Mhz

  Note: Configure stick back to frequency and modulation in use
        after charging port is transmitted, or the stick will be
        configured to 433.92Mhz after transmittion.

# Import cap files
https://github.com/CharlesTheGreat77/YardstickOneGUI/assets/27988707/d4a2dfc2-ba38-498d-9855-0fda455a7c13

- Yardstick is configured to the settings set in the cap file

# Key Note
1. Configure button resets the signals list.. so signals still in the text box will NOT be
   in the signals list. You can simply CTRL A and delete to empty the box.
2. "Manually configure Yardstick one" is not working YET! Bear wit meh

# To do
1. Change output for more modern (pretty) asthetic.
2. Allow individual signals to be transmitted.
3. Create tab to manipulate and transmit signals.
4. Allow flipper key files to be transmitted.

# Bug
Spectrum analyzer bugs out and crashes the app... so till then, if you're using it..
you'll have to rerun the app after it closes..
